Description: The RGM R package offers a comprehensive solution to a fundamental challenge in Mendelian randomization (MR) studies. While MR has proven valuable in establishing causal relationships between exposures and outcomes, it traditionally focuses on single exposures' effects on specific outcomes. However, complex biological systems often involve interdependent outcomes influenced by a myriad of factors. RGM's intended use addresses this limitation by adopting a network-based approach that explores the broader causal landscape. By leveraging the network structure, RGM provides a versatile platform to construct causal graphs capturing interactions between response variables and between responses and instrument variables. Notably, RGM supports three input formats, accommodating individual level data and two types of summary level data. This adaptability allows researchers to work with various data availability scenarios. The package's outputs include estimates of causal effects, adjacency matrices, and other valuable parameters, collectively contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of intricate relationships within complex biological networks.
