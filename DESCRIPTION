Description: The MR.RGM package presents a comprehensive solution to a central challenge encountered in Mendelian randomization (MR) studies. While MR has proven invaluable in establishing causal links between exposures and outcomes, its conventional approach focuses primarily on discerning the effects of individual exposures on specific outcomes. However, biological systems are often intricate, involving interdependent outcomes influenced by numerous factors. MR.RGM addresses this limitation by embracing a network-based methodology, allowing for a broader exploration of the causal landscape. By leveraging network structures, MR.RGM provides a versatile framework for constructing causal graphs that capture interactions between response variables and between responses and instrument variables. Notably, MR.RGM accommodates three input formats, facilitating analysis with individual-level data and two types of summary-level data. This flexibility enables researchers to navigate various data availability scenarios effectively. The outputs of the package include estimates of causal effects, adjacency matrices, and other essential parameters, collectively enhancing our understanding of complex biological networks. Additionally, MR.RGM facilitates uncertainty quantification for specific network structures among response variables, further enriching its analytical capabilities.
