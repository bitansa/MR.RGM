Description: Reciprocal graphical models are implemented in this R package for integrative gene regulatory network analysis. This R-package will estimate gene-gene interactions and gene-DNA interactions for a given dataset of gene expressions and DNA expressions, and will then produce a graph linking them. The auxiliary functions in this package provide Gibbs samples of the parameter values of the prior distributions and interaction parameter values depending on other parameter values. The package have two main functions that will estimate the magnitude of gene-gene and gene-DNA interactions utilizing gibbs estimations of these parameters generated by the helper functions at each iteration.
