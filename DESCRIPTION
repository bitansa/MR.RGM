Description: This R-package will estimate the protein-protein interactions and the protein-DNA interactions for a given dataset of protein and DNA expressions and then make a graph connecting them. The package can estimate the graph structure for both individual level data and summary level data both when Spike and Slab or Threshold priors are assumed on the interaction parameters. The package includes various helper functions to generate posterior samples. It has a single primary function that, based on these posterior samples, will give estimations of protein-protein interactions, protein-DNA interactions, and the graph structure between them.
